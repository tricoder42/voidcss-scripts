VoidCSS Scripts
===============

Scripts for building and testing of VoidCSS plugins.
Inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/).

Gettings started
----------------

Only available command at the moment is `voidcss-scripts test`, which executes
all `sass` tests in `*.test.scss` files.
